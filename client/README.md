## Overview

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Throughout this module, you'll create a small app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

As a user, I'd like to view the list of books, so that whenever I visit the page, I can see the a full list of best books.

<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started

You will READ book data by connecting your front-end React app to a back-end Express server. Your Express server will connect to a MongoDB database. You will need to make a "schema" in your back-end code to model how you want your data to look. You will then populate your database with "seed" dataâ€”some of your favorite books. When the front end makes a request to your server, your server will query the database and respond with all of the results from the database. Your front end will display these results.
